I am doing a project using data from the https://forexsb.com/historical-forex-data where I try to create a model to make predictions on various currency exchanges. With this project my main aims are to learn:
- Using Pyspark in a real project and see its ups and downs.
- Creating a pipeline for both the data preparation and for the model deployment
- Deploy a model and make predictions with it.
- Integrate model to a website (Never done before !!)
- To get a greater grasp at time-series data
