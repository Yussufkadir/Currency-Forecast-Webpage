I am doing a project using data from the https://forexsb.com/historical-forex-data where I try to create a model to make predictions on various currency exchanges. With this project my main goals are to learn:
- Using Pyspark in a real project and see its ups and downs.
- Creating a pipeline for both the data preparation and for the model deployment
- Deploy a model and make predictions with it.
- Integrate model to a website (Never done before !!)
- To get a greater grasp at time-series data


What I must learn and some question marks left on me (I do not understand this concepts in expert level and I could not get precise answers from the resouces that I use)
- How to perform statistical testings appropriately
- Why does taking daily seasonality testing throws nan value and rest of the time ranges do not do it.
